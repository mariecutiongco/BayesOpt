# BayesOpt
Bayesian optimization for topography exploration
The files uploaded here uses topography parameters as an example, but is easily extendable to optimization of biological function using morphome (or image based response of cells to nanotopography). 
To see the results, open the .nb.html file in another browser. 
R code is found in the .Rmd file
Python code is found in the .py files
